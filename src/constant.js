  question1: "What is DevOps?",
  answer1:
    "DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle, deliver high-quality software continuously, and improve collaboration between development and operations teams. DevOps emphasizes automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and monitoring to achieve these objectives.",
  question2: "What is the role of monitoring and observability in DevOps?",
  answer2:
    "DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) ",
  question3: "What is Continuous Integration (CI)?",
  answer3:
    "Continuous Integration (CI) is a DevOps practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, preferably several times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by an automated build and automated tests. The primary goal of CI is to detect errors quickly and improve software quality by enabling early detection of integration issues.",
  question4: "What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?",
  answer4:
    "Continuous Delivery (CD) is a DevOps practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. It builds upon Continuous Integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. Continuous Delivery ensures that the software can be reliably released at any time, and with minimal manual intervention.",
